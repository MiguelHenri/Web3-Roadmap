# ðŸ—º Web3 Roadmap

A roadmap for [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) development, divided into three steps.

## ðŸ–‹ Step 1 - Solidity Smart Contract

In this first step, we will implement a basic [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) smart contract.

## ðŸ”— Step 2 - Hyperledger Besu Private Blockchain

In the second step, we will run a private blockchain using [Hyperledger Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/private-networks). We will also deploy our smart contract on this new network.

## âš™ Step 3 - Transactions using Web3.py

In the final step, we will interact with our smart contract using the [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library.
